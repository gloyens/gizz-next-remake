# Changes

Changes released on October 28th, 2022, after having been in the works for five years. It's definitely the most considered of the three October releases - the others being [Laminated Denim](/albums/laminated-denim) and [Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava](/albums/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava) - and it's great. There's so much to say about this album, which combines the complexity of [Polygondwanaland](/albums/polygondwanaland), the mellow, jazzy vibe of [Sketches](/albums/sketches-of-brunswick-east), and the cyclical tracklist of [Nonagon Infinity](/albums/nonagon-infinity) into its own gorgeous tapestry of sound, that it would be impossible to fully explore it here. Oh, and the tracklist spells out Changes. Neat!
