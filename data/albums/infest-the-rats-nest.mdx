# Infest the Rats' Nest

Infest The Rats' Nest shares an environmentalist theme with King Gizzard's other 2019 album, [Fishing For Fishies](/albums/fishing-for-fishies), but that's as far as the similarities go. The heavy metal sound is a relatively new direction for King Gizzard, but one they pull off with ease - so much so, in fact, that it's not unusual to see it in fans' top album lists alongside Paper Mâché Dream Balloon.

Fans of Metallica, Slayer and the like will love this album, but even if that doesn't sound like you, don't let it stop you from giving it a try - Infest The Rats' Nest has been known to make fans of even total newbies to the genre.
