# Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava

The most important thing to know about Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava is that the accepted shorthand is Ice Death. It was one of three albums released in October 2022, the others being [Laminated Denim](/albums/laminated-denim) and [Changes](/albums/changes).

Besides this, Ice Death is the band's jammy album; a celebration marking the end of lockdown, and the first time the band could play together again in person. Each song is an extended jam played in one of the seven Greek modes, similar in structure but wildly different in mood. With each track curated from a day's worth of jams, Ice Death brings an improvisational feel normally only found in live shows into a tight studio album.
