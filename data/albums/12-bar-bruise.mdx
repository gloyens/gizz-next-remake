# 12 Bar Bruise

12 Bar Bruise is the first album in King Gizzard's catalogue ([Willoughby's Beach](/albums/willoughbys-beach) is technically an EP), and is probably the most raucous entry in their discography. The garage rock sound is refined and improved in subsequent albums - [Nonagon Infinity](/albums/nonagon-infinity) being a highlight - but there's something about the raw, unpolished nature of 12 Bar Bruise that make it a uniquely fun listen.
