# Willoughby's Beach

Somewhat overshadowed by its counterpart, [12 Bar Bruise](/albums/12-bar-bruise), Willoughby's Beach is nevertheless a solid first album (well, EP) and a great entry point to the band for fans of garage rock.

Willoughby's Beach is interesting in that you can already hear King Gizzard start to experiment with its sound - note the theremin in Crookedile, and the harmonica in Stoned Mullet that can still be heard as late as [Omnium Gatherum](/albums/omnium-gatherum).
