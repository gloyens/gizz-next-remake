# Oddments

Oddments is the first of three catch-all albums that contain songs which don’t have a single cohesive theme, the others being [Gumboot Soup](/albums/gumboot-soup) and [Omnium Gatherum](/albums/omnium-gatherum). That being said, the album’s mostly acoustic, so you’ll be well-served by the recommendations below.

Oddments is also home to King Gizzard’s most popular song, Work This Time, whose recent post-pandemic performances have come accompanied with face-melting guitar solos that add an entirely new dimension to an already 10/10 track. It’s definitely worth checking out those live shows when you have the opportunity.
