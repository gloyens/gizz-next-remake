# Flight B741

Flight B741 is pure, unadulterated fun. The grooves are undeniable, and the layered gizzy goodness is present in every tune - from earworms like Sad Pilot, to the bouncing beat of Le Risque, to the slightly bizarre Hog Calling Contest. This album certainly packs a hell of a punch. It's the sister album to [Phantom Island](/albums/phantom-island), which has similar song structures but a totally different vibe.

The real star of the show, is the band's vocal performances. For the first time, all six band members are represented, with bassist Lucas Harwood on the title track, and drummer Michael Cavanagh on Le Risque (an iconic performance). Multi-instrumentalist and songwriter Joey Walker's vocals are a noticeable step up from previous albums. It's truly a joy to listen to.

Sonically, this album's closest to [Fishing for Fishies](/albums/fishing-for-fishies), (If you ignore [Phantom Island](/albums/phantom-island), at least)but conceptually it's a bit jammier - closer, perhaps, to [Laminated Denim](/albums/laminated-denim). It feels like a balance between the wild jam sessions of [IDPLMAL](/albums/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava), and the tighter, more deliberate format of earlier albums - a natural evolution of their sound.
