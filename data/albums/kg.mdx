# K.G.

K.G. is the second volume in the microtonal trilogy, and the first of King Gizzard's self-titled double albums. It represents a maturing in the band's approach to microtonal music, and yet still manages to pack in an insane amount of variety - from the Anatolian disco-funk of Intrasport, to the doomy, sludgy Hungry Wolf Of Fate, to the sweet and melodic Honey.

Such an experimental approach to each track in an album is rare, and even more so when considering it's already based on a scale that's unfamiliar to many Western ears. But King Gizzard is nothing if not comfortable in unfamiliar territory, and K.G. is testament to that.
