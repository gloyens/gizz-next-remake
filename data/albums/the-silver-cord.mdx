# The Silver Cord

King Gizz has dabbled n electronic music before - see [Acarine](/albums/fishing-for-fishies) and [Gondii](/albums/changes) - but The Silver Cord is their first full-length album (unless you count [Made in Timeland](/albums/made-in-timeland), the relatively tight 30-minute soundscape). And it packs a massive punch.

Initially billed by frontman Stu as 'a yin yang thang', The Silver Cord is a synth-only odyssey that mirrors previous album [Petrodragonic Apocalypse](/albums/petrodragonic-apocalypse), with lyrics and motifs coming through on every song.

It's also unique in that it includes both a regular and an extended edition. The extended edition is the definitive version, at a whopping 88 minutes long. Does that make it a double album, or a triple album? Nobody knows.

In any case, it's another feather in the cap of the world's most genre-fluid band. Highlights include Set, Gilgamesh, Theia (extended), and the mind-bending extended title track.
