# The Silver Cord

The Silver Cord is King Gizzard's 25th full-length album and their second released in 2023.  Eschewing guitars, this album's synthesizers and electronic drums are a stark contrast to [PetroDragonic Apocalypse](/albums/petrodragonic-apocalypse), the heavy-guitar-heavy album released just a few months earlier.  However, the spirit of both albums is intertwined as each of the 7 tracks from each album relates to a "sister" track on the other.  Listeners will delight at the lyrical, musical and thematic passages that appear on both albums.

The Silver Cord was released in both a 28-minute _standard_ edition as well as an 88-minute _extended_ edition.  The standard edition vinyl release includes an additional 12 minutes of music in the form of 3 "hidden" tracks.

The band has released a single music video from the album.  Created by longtime collaborator Jason Galea, the video showcases the album's opening [Theia / The Silver Cord / Set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jnsD-fEHdY) medley.
