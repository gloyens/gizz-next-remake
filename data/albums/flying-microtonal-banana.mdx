# Flying Microtonal Banana

If your introduction to a band called King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard was the music video for Rattlesnake, from the album Flying Microtonal Banana, you'd be forgiven for thinking the entire thing was a joke. But this album's a consistent fan favourite - as long as you've gotten used to the screaming banshee noises of the zurna, at least.

It's definitely the weirdest album in King Gizzard's discography, so don't worry if you don't immediately enjoy it. But there's some really fantastic tracks in Flying Microtonal Banana, Nuclear Fusion and Sleep Drifter being some highlights. One day it'll click, and you'll be bopping along to Rattlesnake with the rest of us.
