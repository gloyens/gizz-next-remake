# Murder of the Universe

Murder Of The Universe is definitely one of the weirder records out there. It rocks, but the focus of this album is more on the story – so much so, in fact, that it’s sometimes half-seriously referred to as “post-audiobook”. Listen to this when you’re able to fully focus on the lyrics, and you’ll be rewarded with an existential, 3-part epic of wizards, cyborgs and mythical beasts.

Murder Of The Universe culminates in the story of the mysterious Han-Tyumi, a reccurring gizzverse character referenced in albums ranging from [Nonagon Infinity](/albums/nonagon-infinity) to [Sketches Of Brunswick East](/albums/sketches-of-brunswick-east).
