# Quarters!

Quarters! is a concept album split into four songs, each 10 minutes and 10 seconds in length, and it’s also home to The River, one of King Gizzard’s most well-known tracks. It’s consistently played as an extended jam in live shows, and visuals from the music video have endured over time (many fans, and even some band members, have joined the “gator gang” by getting tattoos of the alligator featured in the video).

But while The River is the star of the show, it’s certainly not the only great track on Quarters!. A personal recommendation is Lonely Steel Sheet Flyer, and other fans will swear by either of the remaining tracks. Either way, Quarters! is a great jazzy album that'll appeal to fans and newbies alike.
