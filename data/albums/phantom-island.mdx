# Phantom Island

Good god, what an album. King Gizzard blasts headfirst into their orchestral debut, and - as we've come to expect - creates something magical in the process. Where do they even go from here?

Phantom Island can be considered the sister album to [Flight B741](/albums/flight-b741). For the most part they were created alongside one another, and have a noticeably similar song structure. Aside from that, though, Phantom Island stands alone. Tracks like Grow Wings and Fly and the title track harken back to their days of tighter, self-encapsulated songs, while the remainder explore their newer, jammier sound.

If you get the chance to see an orchestral show, make sure you don't miss it. Even for Gizz, this one's something special.
