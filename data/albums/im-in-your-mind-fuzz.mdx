# I'm In Your Mind Fuzz

I’m In Your Mind Fuzz is frequently suggested as a starting point for new Gizzheads, and with good reason. It offers a good mixture of heavy and mellow tracks, and the first four songs – known as the Mind Fuzz suite – give a glimpse into the band’s affinity for overarching concepts within their albums (although, the prize for King Gizzard’s first concept album goes to [Eyes Like The Sky](/albums/eyes-like-the-sky)). Everything comes together in a fun, accessible package that’s consistently ranked among the band’s best albums.
