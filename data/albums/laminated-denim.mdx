# Laminated Denim

One of three albums released in October 2022 - the others being [Changes](/albums/changes) and [Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava](/albums/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava) - Laminated Denim consists of two epic 15-minute jams - exactly like its predecessor, [Made In Timeland](/albums/made-in-timeland) (the two albums' titles are also anagrams of one another). Sonically, though, the album is much closer to Ice Death, released just five days previously. Similar to [Polygondwanaland](/albums/polygondwanaland), it makes heavy use of polyrhythms, with a constant motorik beat running through.

The vinyl also comes in a denim sleeve!
