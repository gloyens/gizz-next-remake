# Fishing For Fishies

Sandwiched between King Gizzard's insane 5-album 2017 run and the awesomely heavy [Infest The Rats' Nest](/albums/infest-the-rats-nest), Fishing For Fishies has a tendency to be overlooked. But it really shouldn't be, because it's a fantastically groovy album (if the three tracks with "boogie" in the title didn't tell you that already). It's an easy, accessible listen, all the way up to dark synths of Acarine and Cyboogie.

On the surface that's a bizarre switch, but in the context of the album it works perfectly. King Gizzard's been known to experiment with an idea and then release an album revolving around it - compare [Gumboot Soup](/albums/gumboot-soup)'s Great The Chain Of Being with [Infest The Rats' Nest](/albums/infest-the-rats-nest) - so if we're lucky, this won't be the last we hear of this sound.
