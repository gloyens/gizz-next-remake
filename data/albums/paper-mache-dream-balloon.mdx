# Paper Mâ​ché Dream Balloon

It’s weird to think that this is the same band that made [Infest The Rats’ Nest](/albums/infest-the-rats-nest), but that’s King Gizzard for you. Paper Mâché Dream Balloon is the band’s most relaxed album, excepting perhaps [Sketches Of Brunswick East](/albums/sketches-of-brunswick-east), and is recorded almost entirely on acoustic instruments.

While the music is lovely – Sense, Trapdoor and Time = Fate being some highlights – it’s worth also listening to the lyrics of the entire album, which are deceptively dark. Paper Mâché Dream Balloon is consistently ranked among fans’ top Gizz albums, and it’s a great place to start for people looking for something more accessible in the band’s catalogue.
