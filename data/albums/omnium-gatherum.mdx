# Omnium Gatherum

Just when you think King Gizzard can't surprise you anymore, they drop two honest-to god rap tracks. Omnium Gatherum is the third of the band's miscellaneous song collections (the others being [Oddments](/albums/oddments) and [Gumboot Soup](/albums/gumboot-soup)), and it's stuffed to the brim with new sounds. Kepler-22b's sampling is reminiscent of Nujabes; the buttery-smooth Ambergris wouldn't feel out of place on a Thundercat record; and Candles sounds more like Mild High Club than the bands' official collaboration album.

The star of the show, though, has got to be the 18-minute behemoth of an opener, The Dripping Tap. It represents the first time the band came together to jam at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it rocks. Clocking in at a massive 80 minutes, Omnium Gatherum is sure to have something to suit your tastes.
