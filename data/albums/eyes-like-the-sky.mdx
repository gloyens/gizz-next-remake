# Eyes Like The Sky

Perhaps the strangest entry in King Gizard’s catalogue, Eyes Like The Sky is more of spaghetti western audiobook put to music than anything else, created in response to being typecast in previous releases. Written and narrated by band member Ambrose Kenny-Smith’s father, Broderick Smith, Eyes Like The Sky tells the story of the life of a boy growing up on the American Frontier. It’s certainly an album you need to be in the right mood to listen to, but when that mood hits, you’re in for a treat.

If you’re in need of more cult-western stories and evil guitars, head over to [12 Bar Bruise’s](/albums/12-bar-bruise) Sam Cherry’s Last Shot, or [Flying Microtonal Banana’s Billabong Valley](/albums/flying-microtonal-banana).
