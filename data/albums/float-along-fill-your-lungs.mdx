# Float Along, Fill Your Lungs

Float Along - Fill Your Lungs is all killer, no filler - it's King Gizzard's most psychedelic album, starting with one of the band's jammiest tracks, Head On/Pill, and ending with perhaps its most melancholic. The sound of Float Along's title track hasn't been replicated since.

The rest of the album is chock-full of Gizz classics, from the quintessential Cookie track, Pop In My Step ("Cookie" being band member Cook Craig), to the slightly bizarre but equally catchy I'm Not A Man Unless I Have A Woman (and yes, that's Ambrose singing).
