# Polygondwanaland

Fans of King Gizzard don’t agree on much, but if you ask them what their favourite album is, there’s a good chance they’re going to say Polygondwanaland. With its otherworldly story and intricate use of polyrhythms, Polygondwanaland is among King Gizzard’s most technically complex albums, standing shoulder to shoulder with prog greats like Yes and King Crimson.

This album won’t click for everyone on the first listen, but when it does, it’s sensational. It’s almost blasphemous to suggest for an album that should really be experienced in its entirety, but if you’re not familiar with the genre, The Horology Suite (Inner Cell – Loyalty - Horology) is a good place to start.
