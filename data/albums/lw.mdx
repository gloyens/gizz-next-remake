# L.W.

Perhaps due to oversaturation of the microtonal sound, upon release L.W. was met with a slightly more muted response than its predecessor. That's a shame, because when looking at it in hindsight it's probably the stronger of the two.

O.N.E. is one of the all time great Gizz tracks, K.G.L.W. is pure doomy, spooky goodness, and If Not Now Then When is a really unique entry with a fantastic music video. All in all, L.W. is a top-tier album that perfectly rounds out the microtonal trilogy.
