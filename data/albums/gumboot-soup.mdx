# Gumboot Soup

Gumboot Soup was the fifth album released in 2017, and, similar to [Oddments](/albums/oddments) and [Omnium Gatherum](/albums/omnium-gatherum), contains a collection of songs that didn’t quite fit on any other record. That being said, most songs share clearly share similar elements to other albums that the band released before or since – so take a look through the tracks, and if anything takes your fancy, there’s a good chance you’ll be well served by the recommended album.
