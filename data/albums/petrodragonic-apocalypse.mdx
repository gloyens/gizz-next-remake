# PetroDragonic Apocalypse

The brutal heaviness of [Infest the Rats' Nest](/albums/infest-the-rats-nest) meets the wild complexity of [Polygondwanaland](/albums/polygondwanaland), then cranks it up to 11. This record is pure insanity, right from Motor Spirit's Mongolian throat singing all the way through to Flamethrower's machine-gun guitar. And if you're lucky enough to own PetroDragonic Apocalypse on vinyl, you'll be treated to an exclusive spoken-word closer featuring [Murder of the Universe's](/albums/murder-of-the-universe) own Leah Senior.

Don't miss the music videos for Dragon and Gila Monster, campy in the best way and reminiscent of classic Gizz vids like [Trapdoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQvIvKG_ktY) and [People Vultures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f78_Tf4Tdk). Fantastically well-received by fans and critics alike, PDA is sure to go down as one of King Gizzard's best records.

Oh, and it beats out [Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava](/albums/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava) for longest album title. Its full name is _PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Night: An Annihilation of Planet Earth and the Beginning of Merciless Damnation_. Rolls right off the tongue!
