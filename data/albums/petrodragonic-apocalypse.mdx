# PetroDragonic Apocalypse

PetroDragonic Apocalypse is King Gizzard's upcoming 24th studio album. Here's what we know about it so far:
- it's going to be ***[heavy](https://twitter.com/kinggizzard/status/1648467246069710848?s=20)***, maybe even moreso than [Infest the Rats' Nest](/albums/infest-the-rats-nest)
- The first single to be released will be Gila Monster, shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpocbpy082I) live in Tilburg
- It will likely include a track called "Converge" - you can listen to the demo below (track 16).

Oh, and it beats out [Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava](/albums/ice-death-planets-lungs-mushrooms-and-lava) for longest album title. Its full name is *PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Night: An Annihilation of Planet Earth and the Beginning of Merciless Damnation*.  Rolls right off the tongue!
