# Sketches of Brunswick East

Sketches Of Brunswick East is the product of a collaboration with Mild High Club's Alex Brettin, and it competes with [Paper Mâché Dream Balloon](/albums/paper-mache-dream-balloon) for the title of most relaxed King Gizzard album. If you're at all familiar with Mild High Club, this won't come as a surprise to you.

Sketches Of Brunswick East is very much jazz-based, but there's still some classic Gizz weirdness that shines through - note the microtones on D-Day, and the cameo from [Murder Of The Universe](/albums/murder-of-the-universe)'s Han-Tyumi on Tezeta. Overall, it's an accessible, endlessly replayable album loved by fans and newbies alike.
