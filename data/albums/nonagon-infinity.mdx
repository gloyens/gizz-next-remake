# Nonagon Infinity

Nonagon Infinity was the band’s breakthrough album, and can be considered the undiluted essence of King Gizzard’s sound. Featuring nine tracks that blend seamlessly into one another – including the last into the first, hence the name – Nonagon Infinity offers a cascade of raw garage power, loved by long-time fans and new listeners alike. It also forms part of the holy trinity of classic Gizz albums, along with [I’m In Your Mind Fuzz](/albums/im-in-your-mind-fuzz) and [Polygondwanaland](/albums/polygondwanaland).
