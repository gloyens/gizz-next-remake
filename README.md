# Get Into Gizz
### Live website: https://www.get-into-gizz.com

## What is this project?
This is a website aimed at introducing people to Australian rock band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. Users can navigate through different albums based on their tastes, similar to a flowchart.

Now band-approved!

## Aim
The focus of this website was not so much learning as it was making something that would actually be useful to a lot of people. Although, in theory, I know a lot about HTML/CSS/JavaScript, it has never been put into practice in a fully-fledged, functional website.
That’s what this website is. It was very well-received – you can read the discussion on the initial announcement thread [here](https://redd.it/wgv0fo). For a first real attempt at a website, I believe I achieved what I set out to do, and I’m extremely proud of the overall response.

## How it works
There is not much to this website – it’s almost totally HTML and CSS. In fact the only elements with JavaScript functionality are the open/close menu buttons, and the Random Album menu option.

## Future Plans
Based on feedback, there are two major updates that I’d like to put out:
1. Add a search bar, to allow people to search by album or by song. This would be very useful and would also allow me to practice JavaScript, which wasn’t used very much in this project.
2. Add a system to explore live albums, demos and bootlegs, all of which are available on Bandcamp but perhaps should not be featured as prominently as the albums.
Additionally, the CSS file is extremely messy as I’ve never created such a large project and I don’t have any sort of system in place to keep it organised. For now it’s fine, but for future projects I might explore Sass or TailwindCSS.

### Known Issues
- Large images on the first page cause it to load slowly.
- /album-pages/ folder included in the url (e.g. get-into-gizz.com/album-pages/quarters).
